        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hey!
            <br>
            <br> I am currently a student at Staffordshire University, where I study BSc Computing Science. This degree aids
            in giving me a broad knowledge of the Computing industry, teaching me several widely used programming languages
            and techniques.
            <br>
            <br>However, this is not my first endeavour into Computing. I also studied A level Computer Science at Trinity Sixth
            Form, alongside Mathematics, Philosophy and Ethics, and History.
            <br>
            <br>I am also a
            <strong>
                <a href="http://www.instagram.com/jacobswetmore">self taught photographer</a>
            </strong>, specialising in music photography, quickly establishing myself as the 'go to' photographer, for local band
            photography in my city, amassing nearly 1,200 followers. This demonstrates my ability to quickly pick up new
            skills, in an independent manner.
            <br>
            <br>This love for music photography is the spawn of my eye for design, and my other passion in life; music. I play
            several instruments, including the drums, guitar, bass, ukulele and cajon. Two of these instruments I play in
            bands, which demonstrates my ability to work with others in a team, under stressful, and demanding situations.
            <br>
            <br>Thank you for taking the time to look at my website! I look forward to working with you.
            <br>
            <br>~ Jacob Swetmore.

        <h1>Technical Skills</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Design</strong>: Due to working as a photographer, I am very proficient in Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. I also
            have a basic understanding of Adobe Illustrator
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Programming</strong>: After one year at University, I have gained an intermediate understanding of Object Oriented
            programming languages, such as Java and C++, some of the most commonly used programming languages in the industry
            today. I also have a basic understanding of Python.
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Web</strong>: My first year at University has also given me an intermediate understanding of the Web Trinity:
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These languages are absolute essentials when it comes to Web Development, and I believe
            I have a good understanding of the three, and how they interact.
